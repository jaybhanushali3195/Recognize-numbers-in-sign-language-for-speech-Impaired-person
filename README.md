# Recognize numbers in sign language for speech Impaired person
This multiclass classification problem is solved by building a deep Neural net in Tensorflow for recognizing the hand signs.Preprocessing is done on training data as well as labels are 
converted into one hotmatrices, placeholders are created and model is build using various helper functions.A mini batch Gradient descent algorithm is appliedand Adams Optimizer is used.The train accuracy 
came out to be 99.9% where as testing accuracy was 72% which was decent given the small size of training data set.
